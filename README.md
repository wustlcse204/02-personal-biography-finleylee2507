# Assignment 02-Personal-Bio

For this assignment, you need to create a valid html web page containing a personal biography/resume/profile either for you, or for a famous celebrity.

You are required to make use of the HTML elements we have learned in class so far.

Specifically, your web page needs to include one of each of the following elements:

* Title
* Headings (at least one sub-heading)
* Paragraphs
* Bold or Strong
* Italic or Emphasis
* Horizontal Rule
* Abbreviation
* Unordered List, Ordered List, or Definition List
* Links - at least one link to an external website.

Note, this list is only of the required elements- feel free to use more than just these.
